    title: 'Set Yourself Up for Success',
    paragraph:
        "Although you may be able to get your work done at a cramped desk, in poor light, or while you peer at a far-away computer screen, none of these things is great for your body. When you hold yourself in awkward positions, you may get problems with your muscles, tendons, ligaments, or nerves.",

    title: 'Make Leg Room a Priority',
    paragraph:
        "Choose a work surface that offers plenty of space for your knees, thighs, and feet. Try not to sit directly in front of drawers or cabinets. They can keep you from getting as close to your computer as you should. If you need a higher surface, use sturdy boards, bricks, or blocks to prop up your desk or table legs.",

    title: 'Protect Your Back',
    paragraph:
        "To help keep a healthy posture, an office chair with lumbar (low back) support is best. If you use a hard-backed chair, choose one that lets your knees stay level with your hips. Pad it with a seat cushion and place a rolled-up towel behind your lower back. If your chair has armrests, adjust them so your shoulders stay relaxed.",

  tips(
    title: 'Support Your Feet',
    paragraph:
        "One trick to getting your posture right: Keep your feet flat on the floor. If the chair you use doesn't allow that to happen, use a footrest. You can also place a small stack of sturdy books under your feet.",

    title: 'Keep Your Screen at Eye Level',
    paragraph:
        "If your computer screen is too low, you'll have to tuck your chin into your chest to see it. This can lead to neck, shoulder, and back pain. If you can, place your screen on a surface that's arm's length away and eye level. If you wear bifocals, your screen will be easiest to view if you lower it 1 to 2 inches more.",

  tips(
    title: 'Get the Lighting Just Right',
    paragraph:
        "Natural light will help you see your work better. To reduce glare, set up your workspace to the side of a window instead of having it in front of or behind you. Your computer screen should be brighter than the sun outside, so adjust your blinds or pull down your shades on sunny days.",

  tips(
    title: 'Rig Up a Standing Desk',
    paragraph:
        "Stay on your feet as you work and you may be less likely to have shoulder or back pain. If you don't have a standing desk, place your laptop on a high counter, shelf, or an ironing board. It may take a while to get used to this way of working. To keep your legs and feet from getting sore, stand for no more than 30 minutes at first. A cushioned kitchen mat will also help.",

    title: 'Keep Your Keyboard in Reach',
    paragraph:
        "If you have to stretch to reach your keyboard, you'll strain your arms. When typing or using a mouse, your wrists should be straight, your elbows close to your body, and your hands even with your elbows or slightly lower.",
